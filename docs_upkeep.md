Instructions:

1. Look for all repo .md files (search in ./_.md, ./dependencies/atcd/_.md).
2. Make sure all content is consistent with the current state of the repository's current branch
   1. look at everything in ./scripts/_.py, ./_.py, and ./dependencies/atcd/\*.R
   2. make sure all markdown documentation files are consistent with each other and with the repo code
3. Ensure all line number references are accurate.
4. Ensure all file paths are also hyperlinked.
5. Based on the repository, ensure all supervisor inputs are up-to-date i.e., we haven't implemented those changes yet (they are pending). Add more points that need supervisor inputs if necessary.
6. Read .gitignore and remove hyperlinks to gitignored repo destinations.
7. Update all .md files accordingly.
