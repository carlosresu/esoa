# Data Dictionary: `outputs/drugs_and_medicine_drugs/esoa_matched_drugs.csv`

Each record in `esoa_matched_drugs.csv` represents one normalized eSOA free-text row, enriched with features, reference lookups, and classification signals produced by [pipelines/drugs/scripts/match_features_drugs.py](https://github.com/carlosresu/esoa/blob/main/pipelines/drugs/scripts/match_features_drugs.py), [pipelines/drugs/scripts/match_scoring_drugs.py](https://github.com/carlosresu/esoa/blob/main/pipelines/drugs/scripts/match_scoring_drugs.py), and [pipelines/drugs/scripts/match_outputs_drugs.py](https://github.com/carlosresu/esoa/blob/main/pipelines/drugs/scripts/match_outputs_drugs.py).

üìò **Where to find implementation notes:** the modules listed above now start
with docstrings summarizing their responsibilities and contain refreshed inline
comments that describe how each column is derived.  Use them alongside this
table when validating new data or onboarding reviewers.

`run_drugs_and_medicine.py` now orchestrates dependency bootstrapping, input preparation, and the post-run execution of `pipelines/drugs/scripts/resolve_unknowns_drugs.py`, so the companion outputs mentioned below (e.g., `outputs/drugs_and_medicine_drugs/unknown_words.csv`) are regenerated automatically each time the pipeline completes.

‚öôÔ∏è **Performance note:** Brand swaps, WHO detection, and other CPU-heavy transforms now fan out across a worker pool when large batches are processed. The helpers keep row order stable, so the column definitions below remain unchanged even when the pipeline runs in parallel.

**`match_molecule(s)` values in daily reporting**

- `ValidMoleculeWithDrugCodeInAnnex` ‚Äì Annex F generic (Drug Code) satisfied scoring checks.
- `ValidMoleculeWithATCinPNF` ‚Äì PNF generic with ATC coverage survived scoring after Annex failed or was absent.
- `ValidBrandSwappedForGenericInAnnex` ‚Äì FDA brand map swap resolved to an Annex F generic that passed subsequent checks.
- `ValidBrandSwappedForGenericInPNF` ‚Äì FDA brand map swap resolved to a PNF generic that passed subsequent checks.
- `ValidBrandSwappedForMoleculeWithATCinWHO` ‚Äì Brand swap landed on a WHO molecule (no PNF coverage) that still carried ATC metadata.
- `ValidMoleculeWithATCinWHO/NotInPNF` ‚Äì WHO molecule matched without any PNF hit; we rely entirely on WHO metadata.
- `ValidMoleculeNoATCinFDA/NotInPNF` ‚Äì FDA generic matched but neither PNF nor WHO produced a molecule/ATC pairing.
- `ValidMoleculeNoCodeInReference` ‚Äì Annex/PNF generic matched but no reference code (Drug Code or ATC) was available.
- `NonTherapeuticFoodWithUnknownTokens` ‚Äì FDA food/non-therapeutic catalog match present together with residual unknown tokens.
- `NonTherapeuticFoodNoMolecule` ‚Äì FDA food/non-therapeutic catalog match and no therapeutic molecule confirmed.
- `NonTherapeuticCatalogOnly` ‚Äì FDA food/non-therapeutic catalog matched while therapeutic catalogs had no coverage.
- `PartiallyKnownTokensFrom_<sources>` ‚Äì Some tokens remain unmatched even after PNF/WHO/FDA drug lookups; the suffix enumerates the datasets (e.g., `PartiallyKnownTokensFrom_PNF_WHO`, `PartiallyKnownTokensFrom_None`) that covered the known portion of the string.
- `NoReferenceCatalogMatches` ‚Äì No PNF/WHO/FDA drug or FDA food catalog entries matched any tokens; requires manual inspection.
- `AllTokensUnknownTo_PNF_WHO_FDA` ‚Äì No catalog (PNF/WHO/FDA) recognized any token in the row; all tokens remain unknown and the row is routed to the Unknown bucket.
- `RowFailedAllMatchingSteps` ‚Äì All reference matching stages failed; no catalogs provided coverage.

**`match_quality` review / auto-accept tags**

- `auto_exact_dose_route_form` ‚Äì Auto-Accept row with exact dose, route, and form alignment against the selected Annex/PNF variant.
- `dose_mismatch_same_atc` ‚Äì Auto-Accept row where the text dose differs but the reference code is unique across variants (policy allows the substitution).
- `dose_mismatch_varied_atc` ‚Äì Auto-Accept row with a non-exact dose where multiple reference codes exist across variants; escalated for targeted reconciliation.
- `dose_mismatch` ‚Äì Recognized dose text disagrees with the selected PNF/WHO dose payload after normalization.
- `form_mismatch` ‚Äì Textual form or inferred form conflicts with the PNF-allowed form family for the chosen route.
- `route_mismatch` ‚Äì Textual route conflicts with the allowed routes for the candidate (including WHO fallbacks when PNF is missing).
- `route_form_mismatch` ‚Äì Route and form combination violates the curated `APPROVED_ROUTE_FORMS` whitelist even if each attribute alone might be acceptable.
- `no_dose_available` / `no_form_available` / `no_route_available` ‚Äì Parsed text lacks the corresponding attribute; we could not impute it with high confidence.
- `no_dose_and_form_available` / `no_dose_and_route_available` / `no_form_and_route_available` / `no_dose_form_and_route_available` ‚Äì Multiple attributes were simultaneously missing, signalling limited metadata.
- `who_metadata_insufficient_review_required` ‚Äì Only WHO supplied the molecule and none of the other checks raised a specific conflict, but we still lack enough corroborating detail to auto-accept.
- `who_does_not_provide_dose_info` ‚Äì We rely on WHO alone and the WHO ATC extract does not expose a DDD; dose comparisons therefore remain unresolved.
- `who_does_not_provide_route_info` ‚Äì We rely on WHO alone and the WHO ATC extract did not expose any Adm.R tokens; route validation falls back to manual review.
- `nontherapeutic_and_unknown_tokens` ‚Äì FDA food/non-therapeutic catalog match present together with residual unknown tokens.
- `nontherapeutic_catalog_match` ‚Äì FDA food/non-therapeutic catalog match with no corroborated therapeutic molecule.
- `unknown_tokens_present` ‚Äì Partial unknown tokens remain after matching against PNF, WHO, and FDA drug lists.
- `manual_review_required` ‚Äì No structured matches materialized; escalated for human triage.
