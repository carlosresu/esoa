- `ValidBrandSwappedForMoleculeWithATCinWHO` â€“ Brand swap landed on a WHO molecule (no PNF coverage) that still carried ATC metadata.
- `ValidMoleculeWithATCinWHO/NotInPNF` â€“ WHO molecule matched without any PNF hit; we rely entirely on WHO metadata.

- `no_dose_and_form_available` / `no_dose_and_route_available` / `no_form_and_route_available` / `no_dose_form_and_route_available` â€“ Multiple attributes were simultaneously missing, signalling limited metadata.
- `who_metadata_insufficient_review_required` â€“ Only WHO supplied the molecule and none of the other checks raised a specific conflict, but we still lack enough corroborating detail to auto-accept.
- `who_does_not_provide_dose_info` â€“ We rely on WHO alone and the WHO ATC extract does not expose a DDD; dose comparisons therefore remain unresolved.
- `who_does_not_provide_route_info` â€“ We rely on WHO alone and the WHO ATC extract did not expose any Adm.R tokens; route validation falls back to manual review.
- `nontherapeutic_and_unknown_tokens` â€“ FDA food/non-therapeutic catalog match present together with residual unknown tokens.
