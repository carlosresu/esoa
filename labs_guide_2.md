# Master Collation Guide – External Reference Datasets

This report organizes the external datasets and knowledge bases needed to deterministically map and enrich the laboratory and diagnostic items found in `esoa_prepared_labs.csv`.  For each dataset the maintainer, scope/coverage, the aspect of a test it helps describe (“slot”), access format and licensing are summarised.  Notes explain how each source maps to local data and identify gaps or issues.  Citations from authoritative pages show evidence of the descriptions.  The user’s time‑zone (Asia/Manila) has been used for date context.

## A. Core standards – universal code systems

| Dataset / Ontology | Maintainer & version | Scope & coverage | Relevant test slots | Format & access | Licensing & URL | How it maps to our data | Notes / gaps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names & Codes) v2.81 (Aug 2025)** | Regenstrief Institute & IEEE | Global standard for lab tests and clinical observations; ~100 k codes covering chemistry, hematology, serology, microbiology and many radiology studies. Each code has component (analyte), property (e.g., substance concentration), system (specimen), method, scale and time. | Component names, specimen, method, scale, property, panel definitions, recommended units. | CSV/JSON/OWL downloads via LOINC site; FHIR API. Free registration required【878901636497849†L123-L131】. | LOINC license: open with free registration; derivative works allowed but rights reserved【465859441712608†L123-L151】. | Will be the backbone for mapping local test names to standard codes; LOINC panel hierarchy helps decompose panels (e.g., CBC into WBC, RBC, Hb). Also provides example units and synonyms. | High coverage for lab tests but some local bundles (e.g., “Executive Panel”) lack direct LOINC codes; radiology coverage less granular than RadLex; panels for local packages may need manual definition.
| **SNOMED CT International Edition (Oct 2025)** | SNOMED International | Comprehensive clinical ontology covering procedures, organisms, specimens, methods, diagnoses and findings. | Observable entities, procedures, specimen types, methods, organisms, imaging procedures. | Available as Release Format 2 (RF2) files through UMLS for members; browser for limited subsets. | Proprietary. Free for member countries/individuals; license required for others【956606457431992†L74-L113】. | Contains concepts for many lab tests and imaging procedures; useful when mapping to EHR systems.  Our project will not distribute SNOMED codes due to license but will use OMOP mappings as a bridge. | Access requires a SNOMED license; not all countries (incl. PH) have full membership.  Will be referenced indirectly (via OMOP/GPS) rather than as a primary source.
| **OMOP Vocabulary (Athena)** | OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) | Consolidated vocabulary for research; aggregates LOINC, SNOMED CT, RxNorm, etc., with pre-built concept relationships. | Cross‑mapping between LOINC and SNOMED concepts; concept IDs for each code. | Downloadable in CSV format after account creation on Athena (free). | Mixed: uses source vocabularies’ licences; accessible for research. | Provides ready‑made mappings (e.g., LOINC to SNOMED, LOINC to OMOP concept ID).  Useful to link our LOINC‑coded tests to SNOMED concepts for interoperability. | Adds no new test definitions beyond underlying vocabularies; mapping quality depends on version; still subject to SNOMED licensing (IDs but not descriptions). |
| **HL7 FHIR Laboratory ValueSets (US Core)** | HL7 International | FHIR profiles and curated value sets for common lab orders/results.  US Core Lab Tests value set includes all LOINC codes where `CLASSTYPE=1` (laboratory tests)【685201796515072†L70-L86】. | LOINC codes used in FHIR observations; expected units (UCUM). | Published as JSON/ValueSet expansions via HL7 or FHIR Terminology server. | Open standard (HL7 Intellectual Property). | Used to verify that our chosen LOINC codes align with FHIR‑based interoperability requirements (e.g., ensuring use of the correct LOINC code and UCUM units). | Does not introduce new codes; serves as a quality check and helps identify high‑priority tests.
| **LABO (Clinical LABoratory Ontology)** | OpenLHS (France) – OBO Foundry | An ontology focusing on laboratory test prescriptions and result reporting as informational entities; formalises tests, orders and reports. | Classes for lab tests (often aligned to LOINC), relationships for preconditions, documents, etc. | OWL ontology available via OBO/BioPortal; open license CC BY 4.0【943529484104078†L92-L110】【991482903607298†L16-L27】. | Open (CC BY 4.0). | Provides a semantic layer for reasoning about tests; helps classify tests beyond simple code mapping (e.g., distinguishing an order from a result). | Coverage limited (~169 classes); not comprehensive for all tests.  Useful for ontology-driven reasoning rather than primary mapping.

## B. Panels & profiles – sources defining test groupings

| Source | Maintainer & scope | Relevant slots | Access & licence | How it helps & notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LOINC Panels & Forms** | Regenstrief Institute | Provides hierarchical definitions for common panels (e.g., CBC, Basic Metabolic Panel, Lipid profile). Each panel code lists member tests and flags optional/required items. | Included in LOINC distribution (CSV) and accessible via FHIR API.  Licensed under LOINC license. | Used to expand panel names in our dataset into component tests and to assign appropriate codes; ensures deterministic mapping of composite tests.  Does not cover local packages like “Executive Panel”, which must be defined manually.
| **UNC i2b2 Common Lab Panels** | University of North Carolina | Curated sets of common lab panels used in UNC’s i2b2 platform. Panels include Basic Metabolic Panel, CBC, coagulation screen, lipid panel, etc.; each group contains high‑yield tests covering ≥75 % of orders【11511798526428†L100-L118】. | Provided as HTML documentation; open for reference. | Serves as real‑world definitions of panels to validate our mapping.  Useful for identifying typical constituents and synonyms.  Coverage is limited to high‑yield panels (rarely ordered components may be absent).
| **WHO Essential Diagnostics List (EDL) 2023** | World Health Organization | Policy list of essential in vitro diagnostic tests for primary care and laboratories. Covers general tests (e.g., glucose, CBC) and disease‑specific tests (HIV, TB, malaria, COVID‑19). | Published via interactive site; not provided as structured dataset but accessible as PDF/online list. Open access. | Ensures that our reference corpus includes all tests considered essential by WHO.  Useful as a checklist to confirm presence of key tests (e.g., high‑sensitivity troponin, parathyroid hormone)【469682822592276†L627-L677】.  Does not provide codes; we must map EDL names to LOINC/SNOMED. |
| **NHS National Laboratory Medicine Catalogue (NLMC)** | NHS England & Royal College of Pathologists | SNOMED‑coded catalogue of UK pathology services (tests and profiles). Provides test definitions, allowable units and sometimes panel membership. | Distributed via NHS TRUD; requires registration. Last updated 2014/2015 and labelled as a “technology preview”【815328488177599†L14-L33】. | Useful for cross‑checking standard test names and units from another healthcare system.  Access is limited, and the content is SNOMED‑centric, so we use it as supplementary reference only.
| **Philippine institutional test lists (e.g., JRRMMC, PGH)** | Department of Health hospitals and university hospitals | Lists of tests and packages used in practice, including local names like “Fecalysis,” “UTZ” (ultrasound), or “Executive Panel.”  Provide pricing and composition for packages. | Typically published as PDFs or price lists on hospital websites; some require FOI requests.  Many are restricted (403 errors); accessible lists may include sample price lists (e.g., some DOH hospitals). | Essential for mapping local terminology and bundled packages.  Because these lists are fragmented and sometimes inaccessible, manual collection from available sources is required.  We noted typical local shorthand such as Fecalysis (stool exam) and UTZ (ultrasound), and categories identified in DOH licensing rules (anatomic pathology, clinical chemistry, clinical microscopy, endocrinology, hematology, immunology/serology, microbiology, toxicology, molecular and nuclear diagnostics)【825700930674168†L74-L77】.

## C. Microbiology & serology – organisms, cultures and susceptibility

| Resource | Maintainer | Scope & coverage | Relevant slots | Format & access | Licensing & URL | How it maps & notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NCBI Taxonomy** | National Center for Biotechnology Information (NIH) | Names and phylogenetic lineages for more than 160 000 organisms with molecular data【727833134042153†L68-L80】. | Organism identifiers and synonyms for bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc. | Downloadable as text (names.dmp, nodes.dmp) via NCBI FTP; API access; public domain. | Public domain; open for reuse. | Provides definitive organism names and IDs for culture results.  We will include the subset relevant to clinical pathogens; used to standardise organism names in culture and serology results. |
| **WHONET Antimicrobial Codes** | WHO Collaborating Centre for Antimicrobial Resistance (Brigham & Women’s Hospital) | A standardized list of antibiotics and short codes used for susceptibility testing.  Includes codes like AMK (Amikacin), AMC (Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid), etc.; last updated 20 Sept 2021【123903681708803†L0-L27】. | Antibiotic names and abbreviations. | Available as PDF list; open access. | Provides the antibiotic codes and corresponding names【123903681708803†L0-L27】.  Helps map sensitivity panels to standard drug names and link to ATC classification. | Must be mapped to a standard drug vocabulary (e.g., ATC, RxNorm) for classification; WHONET codes alone do not include units or breakpoints.
| **LOINC microbiology terms** | Regenstrief Institute | Many LOINC codes exist for microbiology tests: e.g., “Urine culture,” “Gram stain,” “Dengue NS1 antigen,” etc.  Panel structure exists for susceptibility (each antibiotic often gets its own test code). | Test codes for micro procedures and serology. | Included in LOINC distribution; open license. | Used to map micro tests and serologies to standard codes.  Some specialised parasitology tests (e.g., Kato‑Katz for Schistosoma) may lack specific LOINC codes; we will map to the closest LOINC or create local extensions.
| **WHONET & ATC cross‑mapping** | WHO ATC/DDD Collaborating Centre | ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) classification groups drugs by therapeutic use.  The system divides active substances into 14 main groups and further levels【916033361265027†L582-L603】.  Antibiotics for systemic use belong to the “J01” group. | Drug class and chemical identifiers for antibiotics. | ATC index available via WHO website; open access. | Mapping WHONET antibiotic codes to ATC codes allows classification by drug class (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins).  ATC also provides DDDs for consumption analyses. | ATC does not list every brand; mapping may require manual linking between WHONET codes and corresponding ATC codes.

## D. Diagnostic imaging & procedures

| Vocabulary / Standard | Maintainer | Scope & coverage | Relevant slots | Format & access | Licensing & URL | How it helps & notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RadLex Playbook / LOINC‑RSNA Radiology Playbook** | Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) & Regenstrief Institute | Provides standard names and codes for radiology procedures; aims to describe imaging exams based on modality and body part.  Version 2.5 harmonised with LOINC; codes start with “RPID” and mapping to LOINC codes exists【167422870398232†L4-L25】. | Imaging procedure name, modality, body region, technique, view, contrast. | Searchable via playbook website; CSV downloads available after agreeing to license. | RadLex license grants worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free rights to reproduce and distribute the Playbook, provided attribution and modifications are noted【125577845669370†L96-L105】. | Used to map local imaging procedure descriptions (e.g., “Chest X‑ray PA”) to standard codes; includes modality and view attributes.  Future codes will be created in LOINC format, so mapping to LOINC is encouraged【167422870398232†L13-L25】. | Some specialised or combined imaging procedures (e.g., interventional radiology with sedation) may lack direct codes.  Users must accept licence terms before downloading; LOINC will host new codes.
| **DICOM Controlled Terminology** | DICOM Standards Committee (NEMA) | Provides modality codes (e.g., CR, CT, DX, MR, US) and attributes for imaging acquisition; defined in DICOM Part 16 context group 29.  Example codes: CR = computed radiography, CT = computed tomography【532303000988860†L11-L24】. | Imaging modality codes and view positions. | Available in DICOM standard documentation and HL7 terminology service. | DICOM standard is publicly available; codes can be reused freely. | Modality codes and view codes are used to populate the modality and technique slots when mapping imaging procedures; ensures compatibility with PACS and FHIR ImagingStudy resources. | Modality codes alone do not identify the procedure; must be combined with body part and view (handled via RadLex/LOINC).
| **WHO International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI) Beta‑3 (2020)** | World Health Organization | Common tool for reporting and analysing health interventions; covers diagnostic, medical, surgical, mental health, rehabilitation and public‑health interventions.  Built around three axes: Target (body part), Action, and Means.  The Beta‑3 version finalised clinical and functioning components; the public health component was finalised in 2023【214956539664542†L626-L652】. | Intervention code representing Target–Action–Means; extension codes allow added detail【214956539664542†L639-L643】. | Online browsing; ICHI codes are freely available under the same licence as ICD (open). | Provides open international procedure codes for diagnostic imaging and other interventions.  We can assign ICHI codes to imaging procedures to allow global comparison. | Beta‑3 codes may not capture highly granular radiology techniques (e.g., number of views); new codes may be added in the future.
| **FHIR ImagingStudy & Procedure resources** | HL7 International | Defines how imaging studies and procedures are represented in FHIR.  The ImagingStudy resource describes a DICOM imaging study with series and modality; each series is of a single modality and a study can have multiple modalities【166574065165076†L48-L63】. | Structure of imaging data (identifiers, modality, body site) and fields for procedure codes. | Specification is open; accessible via HL7 FHIR website. | Guides our data model to capture modality (DICOM codes), procedure code (RadLex/LOINC), and body site (anatomy ontology) so that the reference aligns with FHIR. | Does not provide codes itself; relies on external vocabularies for procedure and body site; ensures our mapping is FHIR‑ready.
| **CPT®/HCPCS (United States)** | American Medical Association (CPT) & Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (HCPCS) | CPT codes describe procedures (including radiology and lab tests); HCPCS Level II codes cover ancillary services. | Procedure codes for billing. | CPT is proprietary (licensed); HCPCS Level II is public. | Not included in open corpus; only noted for potential mapping if required. | Useful for claims data; due to licensing we will not embed CPT codes, but we will design our corpus so that mapping can be added later.

## E. Units & measurements – standard units and properties

| Standard / Resource | Maintainer | Purpose & coverage | Relevant slots | Format & access | License & URL | How it maps & notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **UCUM (Unified Code for Units of Measure) v2.2 (Jun 2024)** | UCUM Organization (Regenstrief Institute & HL7) | Universal code system for units used in healthcare and science.  Intended to include all units in contemporary use【40824691984740†L74-L82】. | Units of measure; canonical syntax for composite units; conversion relationships. | Specification and XML definitions available on UCUM website; can clone repository or download specification【458744080632925†L16-L26】. | UCUM licence grants a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free licence to reproduce and distribute the specification; prohibits altering its meaning【893226868360001†L20-L33】【893226868360001†L89-L96】. | Used to standardise units for all quantitative tests.  Provides canonical codes for units like mg/dL, mmol/L, IU/mL.  Combined with LOINC property, it allows unit validation and conversion. | Units not in UCUM (rare legacy units) may require manual mapping; derivative works cannot modify UCUM content.
| **LOINC property & unit mappings** | Regenstrief Institute | Each LOINC code has a property (e.g., substance concentration) and example units in the LOINC parts table. | Property type and recommended units. | Included in LOINC CSV tables; open license. | Provides a rule base to determine appropriate units for each test and to interpret values (e.g., mass vs substance concentration). | For local tests not in LOINC, we will assign a property based on similar tests and UCUM units.
| **QUDT (Quantities, Units, Dimensions & Data Types)** | QUDT.org (non‑profit organisation) | Semantic specification for units, quantity kinds and dimensions; used for RDF/JSON data.  Provides base URIs for unit and quantity‑kind vocabularies and supports conversion and dimensional analysis【503180796807578†L17-L47】【503180796807578†L57-L83】. | Dimensional analysis; quantity kind (e.g., mass concentration) associated with units. | Published as OWL/RDF; accessible via QUDT website and SPARQL endpoint. | Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International【503180796807578†L81-L83】. | We will use QUDT (or similar) to enable automated unit conversion and to validate that units match the property (e.g., mmHg belongs to pressure).  It enriches our unit ontology. | More complex than needed for basic mapping; integration optional but recommended for advanced reasoning.
| **HL7 v2 specimen codes (Tables 0070 & 0487)** | HL7 International | List of specimen type codes used in HL7 messaging (e.g., “BLD” for blood, “SER” for serum). | Specimen type. | Provided in HL7 v2 standard; open. | Useful to cross‑reference specimen names when local descriptions use abbreviations.  Limited detail compared to SNOMED; will be used only when an open mapping is needed.
| **Uberon / FMA (Anatomy ontologies)** | OBO Foundry (Uberon) / University of Washington (FMA) | Ontologies of human (and cross‑species) anatomy. | Body part / anatomical site for imaging and specimen context. | OWL ontologies; open access (CC BY or FMA open). | Provide standard identifiers for body parts (e.g., chest, abdomen).  When mapping imaging tests, we will tag the body region with an anatomy term. | Use only the subset relevant to our dataset; consider laterality and composite structures.

## F. Cross‑mapping resources

| Mapping dataset | Maintainer | Source & target codes | Format & access | Usage in our project | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LOINC–SNOMED CT hierarchical crosswalk (OMOP)** | Odysseus Data Services / OHDSI | Maps LOINC laboratory tests to SNOMED CT measurement concepts; provides hierarchical “Is a” relationships so LOINC tests are descendants of SNOMED measurement concepts【768377051427920†L0-L67】. | SQL script and mapping tables available via OHDSI GitHub; accessible for research. | Used to link our LOINC‑coded tests to SNOMED concepts without distributing SNOMED content.  Facilitates interoperability with systems that use SNOMED for observations. | Coverage not complete; quality depends on the collaborative LOINC‑SNOMED mapping project; license restrictions mean we may share only SNOMED identifiers, not descriptions.
| **OMOP concept relationships** | OHDSI | Table of concept mappings that links LOINC codes to OMOP standard concepts (often SNOMED); includes concept IDs and relationship types. | CSV download from Athena (requires account). | Allows us to provide OMOP concept IDs for each test; beneficial for researchers using the OMOP Common Data Model. | OMOP mapping may mark some LOINC codes as “non‑standard”; we will treat LOINC as primary and note when a test maps to a SNOMED concept.
| **UMLS Metathesaurus** | U.S. National Library of Medicine | Aggregates many vocabularies (LOINC, SNOMED CT, ICD, etc.) and provides mappings and synonyms. | Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) linking codes across vocabularies. | Download requires UMLS licence (free with registration); some content restricted. | Could help find additional synonyms or lay terms for tests; used for cross‑checking synonyms. | Because UMLS includes SNOMED, distribution is limited; may be used internally only.

## G. Locale‑specific references

| Resource | Maintainer & details | Purpose | Access & notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DOH Philippines – clinical laboratory licensing and test capability lists** | Department of Health (PH) | Administrative Orders (e.g., AO 2021‑0037) define categories of tests (anatomic pathology, clinical chemistry, clinical microscopy, endocrinology, hematology, immunology/serology, microbiology, toxicology, molecular and nuclear diagnostics)【825700930674168†L74-L77】 and set minimum service capabilities for licensed labs. | Provides official recognition of test disciplines and ensures our reference covers all categories mandated by DOH.  Some documents (Annexes) list required tests; many PDFs are behind FOI/403 barriers.  We rely on accessible sections for general categories.
| **Philippine hospital lab catalogs (e.g., PGH, JRRMMC)** | Government hospitals (UP‑PGH, JRRMMC) | Offer price lists and test names using local nomenclature (e.g., “Fecalysis,” “UTZ,” “Executive panel”). | Some PDFs are publicly accessible, but many require authorisation (403).  Use available lists and domain knowledge to compile local synonyms. | Essential for mapping local test names to standard names.  Common abbreviations include UTZ (ultrasound), FBS (fasting blood sugar), RBS (random blood sugar), CBC, Fecalysis (stool exam), and packages like “Executive Panel A/B/C”.
| **Local terminology & abbreviations** | N/A (colloquial usage) | Shorthand used in PH healthcare: UTZ = ultrasound, ECU = Executive Check‑Up, Fecalysis = stool exam, etc. | Documented through domain knowledge and local sources; not codified in a formal dataset. | Key for lexical matching; we will maintain a synonym dictionary to map local abbreviations to standard terms.
| **PhilHealth benefit package lists** | PhilHealth | Case rate packages sometimes enumerate included tests (e.g., diabetes package includes FBS, HbA1c). | Public circulars; secondary reference for package contents. | Useful for cross‑checking local packages; not primary for code mapping.

## H. Auxiliary ontologies & hierarchies

| Ontology / resource | Maintainer | Scope & purpose | How it will be used | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OBI (Ontology for Biomedical Investigations)** | OBO Foundry / OBI Consortium | Integrated ontology covering investigations, assays, protocols, instruments and data types.  Provides classes for assay methods (e.g., ELISA, PCR) and specimen collection.  Licensed under CC BY 4.0【438437969187428†L158-L168】. | We will use OBI method classes to tag the method used in tests (e.g., immunoassay, PCR).  Helps infer method from keywords and classify tests within a broader framework. | Large ontology; we will import only relevant method and process classes.  Not necessary for basic mapping but essential for semantic enrichment.
| **Uberon / FMA (Anatomy)** | OBO Foundry / University of Washington | Ontologies for human and cross‑species anatomy. | Provide standard identifiers for body parts and laterality (e.g., left wrist, right kidney).  Used to annotate imaging and specimen body sites. | Only a subset of terms relevant to tests will be used; ensures consistent anatomical representation.
| **HL7 specimen codes (Table 0070 / 0487)** | HL7 International | List of specimen type codes (e.g., BLD = blood, SER = serum). | Provides an open alternative to SNOMED specimen codes when license constraints prevent direct SNOMED use.  We will map specimen names to HL7 codes where appropriate. | Limited detail (does not differentiate many specimen subtypes).  SNOMED would be richer but is licensed; HL7 codes suffice for open mapping.
| **QUDT & BFO** | QUDT.org & IFOMIS | QUDT was covered above; Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) provides high‑level categories (material entity, process) underpinning OBI. | Provide semantic consistency when integrating OBI and other ontologies; enable reasoning about test results and measurement properties. | Used internally; not visible to end users.

## I. Inference and rule support

To achieve deterministic mapping and enrich the reference, we will codify rules based on the resources above:

- **Units‑to‑property mapping** – Use UCUM and LOINC properties to infer the physical quantity of a measurement (e.g., mg/dL indicates mass concentration).  QUDT will support dimensional analysis.
- **Method inference** – Keywords in local test names (e.g., “rapid,” “ELISA,” “PCR”) will be mapped to OBI method classes to assign methods when they are not explicitly present.
- **Default specimen assumptions** – For tests without explicit specimens, default to serum/plasma for chemistry tests, whole blood for hematology, etc., following laboratory practice.
- **Temporal context and challenges** – Recognise patterns such as “fasting,” “2 hour post‑load,” “75 g OGTT” and map them to LOINC challenge parts; this distinguishes FBS from RBS and OGTT points.
- **Panel expansion** – Use LOINC panel definitions and local package definitions to expand group names into constituent tests.

These rules will be encoded as part of the knowledge base rather than as independent datasets.

## Conclusion

By collating the above datasets and ontologies, we establish a comprehensive reference framework for mapping the `esoa_prepared_labs.csv` dataset.  LOINC and UCUM form the backbone for test names and units, while RadLex and DICOM support imaging procedures.  Microbiology and drug susceptibility are covered via NCBI Taxonomy, WHONET codes and ATC classification, and cross‑mapping via OMOP ensures interoperability with SNOMED CT.  Auxiliary ontologies like OBI and Uberon enrich method and anatomy information.  Local Philippine sources provide crucial insight into local nomenclature and bundled services, ensuring the reference remains relevant to the context of the dataset.  The combination of standard vocabularies, panels, units, cross‑maps and inference rules will enable deterministic, context‑aligned mapping of each entry in the ESAO dataset.
