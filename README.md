# eSOA Drug Matching Pipeline

This repository implements the **eSOA (electronic Statement of Account) drug matching pipeline**, a dose- and form-aware system that maps free-text medicine descriptions from hospital bills (eSOAs) to standardized drug references:

- **Philippine National Formulary (PNF)**
- **FDA brand map** (brand → generic links from FDA PH online export)
- **WHO ATC classification** (international codes)

It prepares raw CSVs, parses text into structured features, detects candidate generics, scores/classifies matches, and outputs a labeled dataset with a detailed distribution summary and unknown token report. The goal is to support **public health operations and oversight**, not commercial decision-making.

## 🧠 Core Algorithmic Logic

1. Dose Parsing (scripts/dose.py)

Understands expressions like:

- Amounts: 500 mg, 250 mcg, 1 g
- Ratios: 5 mg/5 mL, 1 g/100 mL, x mg per spray
- Packs: 10 × 500 mg (unmasks to 500 mg, not 5000 mg)
- Percents: 0.9%, optionally w/v or w/w
- Compact unit-dose nouns: mg/tab, mg/cap, mg/spray, mg/puff

Normalization:

- Converts g↦mg, µg/μg↦mcg, L↦1000 mL
- Computes mg per mL for ratio doses when possible

Dose similarity (dose_sim):

- ≤0.1% error → 1.0
- ≤5% error → 0.8
- ≤10% error → 0.6
- 10% → 0.0

Public health/program implications  
These thresholds affect how many items are deemed adequate matches automatically vs. flagged for review.

Supervisor input needed

- Is ±10% a suitable tolerance for dose match in this program?
- Should different forms (e.g., inhalation vs. oral solutions) have stricter or looser tolerance?

---

2. Route & Form Detection (scripts/routes_forms.py)

- Recognizes forms (tablet, cap, MDI, DPI, susp, soln, spray, supp, etc.) and maps to canonical routes (oral, inhalation, nasal, rectal, etc.)
- Expands aliases (PO, per os, intranasal, SL, IM, IV, etc.)
- If route is missing but form is known, imputes route from form

Public health/program implications  
Strict route equality may over-flag valid cases when PNF route lists are incomplete.

Supervisor input needed

- Should we require exact route alignment, or allow imputed/fuzzy matches?

---

3. Brand → Generic Swap (scripts/brand_map.py, used in match_features.py)

- Builds Aho–Corasick automata of FDA brand names; maps each to one or more FDA-listed generics with optional dose/form metadata.
- For each eSOA line, we detect brands in the main text and replace with the FDA generic, recording did_brand_swap = True.
- We do not swap text inside parentheses — assumption: parentheses annotate brands when the generic already leads (e.g., paracetamol (Biogesic)).

Public health/program implications  
Brand→generic swaps substantially increase coverage/standardization but can hide dose/form discrepancies when brand packaging differs.

Supervisor input needed

- If a brand maps to multiple generics or variants, should we:
  - prefer PNF-present generics,
  - prioritize dose/form corroboration, or
  - always select the longest/most specific generic token?

---

4. Combination vs. Salt Detection (scripts/combos.py)

- Splits on +, /, with, but masks dose ratios (mg/mL) to avoid false positives.
- Treats known salt/ester/hydrate tails (e.g., hydrochloride, hemisuccinate, palmitate, pamoate, decanoate) as formulation modifiers and not separate molecules.
- Identifies likely combinations when two or more known generic tokens are present (PNF, WHO, or FDA-generic sets).

Public health/program implications  
Impacts whether a line is processed as a single molecule or combination product.

Supervisor input needed

- Confirm policy: should certain esters/salts be treated as distinct actives in surveillance, or as the same base molecule?

---

5. Best-Variant Selection & Scoring (scripts/match_scoring.py)

For each eSOA entry with at least one PNF candidate:

- Scoring
- Form match: +40
- Route match: +30
- Dose similarity (dose_sim × 30)
- Picks the highest-scoring candidate as the best variant and reports:
  - match_quality ∈ {OK, no/poor dose, no/poor form, no/poor route}
  - selected_form, selected_variant, dose_sim, form_ok, route_ok, atc_code_final
- Confidence score (for context):  
  +60 if generic found, +15 dose parsed, +10 route evidence, +15 ATC code, +0–10 from dose_sim, +10 bonus for clean brand swap.
- Auto-Accept policy (conservative):  
  Auto-Accept only if:
  - PNF generic identified
  - ATC code present
  - match_quality == "OK" (dose_sim ≥ 0.6, form_ok, route_ok)

Everything else is Needs Review, unless WHO/FDA-valid but not in PNF.

Public health/program implications  
Stricter acceptance reduces false positives but increases review workload.

Supervisor input needed

- Keep the strict Auto-Accept (~15% auto-accept), or relax back toward confidence-based (~56% auto-accept)?

---

6. Unknown Handling (scripts/match_features.py → unknown_words.csv)

- Extracts tokens not recognized in PNF/WHO/FDA sets.
- Categorizes:
  - Single - Unknown
  - Multiple - All Unknown
  - Multiple - Some Unknown

Public health/program implications  
Frequent unknowns may mean missing formulary entries, local shorthand, or data quality issues.

Supervisor input needed

- Confirm triage workflow: which unknowns trigger formulary enrichment vs local mapping vs data cleaning?
