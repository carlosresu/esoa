# eSOA Drug Matching Pipeline

This repository implements the **eSOA (electronic Statement of Account) drug matching pipeline**, a dose- and form-aware system that maps free-text medicine descriptions from hospital bills (eSOAs) to standardized drug references:

- **Philippine National Formulary (PNF)**
- **FDA brand map** (brand ‚Üí generic links from FDA PH online export)
- **WHO ATC classification** (international codes)

It prepares raw CSVs, parses text into structured features, detects candidate generics, scores/classifies matches, and outputs a labeled dataset with a detailed distribution summary and unknown token report. The goal is to support **public health operations and oversight**, not commercial decision-making.

## üß† Core Algorithmic Logic

1. Dose Parsing (scripts/dose.py)

Understands expressions like:

- Amounts: 500 mg, 250 mcg, 1 g
- Ratios: 5 mg/5 mL, 1 g/100 mL, x mg per spray
- Packs: 10 √ó 500 mg (unmasks to 500 mg, not 5000 mg)
- Percents: 0.9%, optionally w/v or w/w
- Compact unit-dose nouns: mg/tab, mg/cap, mg/spray, mg/puff

Normalization:

- Converts g‚Ü¶mg, ¬µg/Œºg‚Ü¶mcg, L‚Ü¶1000 mL
- Computes mg per mL for ratio doses when possible

Dose similarity (dose_sim):

- ‚â§0.1% error ‚Üí 1.0
- ‚â§5% error ‚Üí 0.8
- ‚â§10% error ‚Üí 0.6
- 10% ‚Üí 0.0

Public health/program implications  
These thresholds affect how many items are deemed adequate matches automatically vs. flagged for review.

Supervisor input needed

- Is ¬±10% a suitable tolerance for dose match in this program?
- Should different forms (e.g., inhalation vs. oral solutions) have stricter or looser tolerance?

---

2. Route & Form Detection (scripts/routes_forms.py)

- Recognizes forms (tablet, cap, MDI, DPI, susp, soln, spray, supp, etc.) and maps to canonical routes (oral, inhalation, nasal, rectal, etc.)
- Expands aliases (PO, per os, intranasal, SL, IM, IV, etc.)
- If route is missing but form is known, imputes route from form

Public health/program implications  
Strict route equality may over-flag valid cases when PNF route lists are incomplete.

Supervisor input needed

- Should we require exact route alignment, or allow imputed/fuzzy matches?

---

3. Brand ‚Üí Generic Swap (scripts/brand_map.py, used in match_features.py)

- Builds Aho‚ÄìCorasick automata of FDA brand names; maps each to one or more FDA-listed generics with optional dose/form metadata.
- For each eSOA line, we detect brands in the main text and replace with the FDA generic, recording did_brand_swap = True.
- We do not swap text inside parentheses ‚Äî assumption: parentheses annotate brands when the generic already leads (e.g., paracetamol (Biogesic)).

Public health/program implications  
Brand‚Üígeneric swaps substantially increase coverage/standardization but can hide dose/form discrepancies when brand packaging differs.

Supervisor input needed

- If a brand maps to multiple generics or variants, should we:
  - prefer PNF-present generics,
  - prioritize dose/form corroboration, or
  - always select the longest/most specific generic token?

---

4. Combination vs. Salt Detection (scripts/combos.py)

- Splits on +, /, with, but masks dose ratios (mg/mL) to avoid false positives.
- Treats known salt/ester/hydrate tails (e.g., hydrochloride, hemisuccinate, palmitate, pamoate, decanoate) as formulation modifiers and not separate molecules.
- Identifies likely combinations when two or more known generic tokens are present (PNF, WHO, or FDA-generic sets).

Public health/program implications  
Impacts whether a line is processed as a single molecule or combination product.

Supervisor input needed

- Confirm policy: should certain esters/salts be treated as distinct actives in surveillance, or as the same base molecule?

---

5. Best-Variant Selection & Scoring (scripts/match_scoring.py)

For each eSOA entry with at least one PNF candidate:

- Scoring
- Form match: +40
- Route match: +30
- Dose similarity (dose_sim √ó 30)
- Picks the highest-scoring candidate as the best variant and reports:
  - match_quality ‚àà {OK, no/poor dose, no/poor form, no/poor route}
  - selected_form, selected_variant, dose_sim, form_ok, route_ok, atc_code_final
- Confidence score (for context):  
  +60 if generic found, +15 dose parsed, +10 route evidence, +15 ATC code, +0‚Äì10 from dose_sim, +10 bonus for clean brand swap.
- Auto-Accept policy (relaxed):
  - Auto-Accept if:
    - PNF generic identified
    - ATC code present
    - form_ok and route_ok
  - Dose mismatch no longer blocks Auto-Accept, but such rows are flagged for supervisors:
    - why_final = "OK, dose mismatch" (or "OK, brand->generic swap (dose mismatch)")
    - reason_final = "no/poor dose match"

Public health/program implications  
Dose mismatches still allow ATC assignment and Auto-Accept, reducing false negatives while keeping supervisor oversight by flagging these cases for review.

Supervisor input needed

- Keep the strict Auto-Accept (~15% auto-accept), or relax back toward confidence-based (~56% auto-accept)?
- Strict Auto-Accept policies reduce false positives but yield fewer auto-accepted matches (~15%).  
  Relaxed policies increase coverage (~56% auto-accept) but may require more supervisor review.  
  Trade-offs include balancing workload vs. completeness and risk tolerance.

6. Unknown Handling (scripts/match_features.py ‚Üí unknown_words.csv)

- Extracts tokens not recognized in PNF/WHO/FDA sets.
- Categorizes:
  - Single - Unknown
  - Multiple - All Unknown
  - Multiple - Some Unknown

Public health/program implications  
Frequent unknowns may mean missing formulary entries, local shorthand, or data quality issues.

Supervisor input needed

- Confirm triage workflow: which unknowns trigger formulary enrichment vs local mapping vs data cleaning?
- Suggested triage options:
  - Formulary enrichment (e.g., add missing drugs to PNF)
  - Local mapping (e.g., create local aliases or shorthand mappings)
  - Data quality remediation (e.g., fix typos, OCR errors, or inconsistent formats)

## ‚úÖ Summary of Items for Supervisor Input

1. Dose tolerance  
   Is the current ¬±10% dose similarity tolerance appropriate for the program‚Äôs needs? Should we consider stricter dose matching for certain forms or routes, such as inhalation products or oral solutions, where small dose differences might have greater clinical significance? Conversely, are there cases where a looser tolerance might be acceptable? How should we balance sensitivity versus specificity in dose matching to optimize public health surveillance?

2. Route/Form strictness  
   Should the pipeline require exact matches between the detected route and form of the eSOA entry and the PNF reference, or allow for imputed or fuzzy matches? For example, should tablets and capsules be considered interchangeable forms (cap ‚Üî tab), or should we enforce strict form equality? How do we handle missing or ambiguous route information‚Äîshould imputed routes from known forms be accepted, or flagged for review? What level of route/form flexibility best supports accurate and practical matching?

3. Auto-Accept policy  
   The current relaxed Auto-Accept policy allows dose mismatches but flags them for supervisor review, increasing auto-accept coverage to about 56%. Alternatively, stricter Auto-Accept policies yield fewer auto-accepted matches (~15%) but reduce false positives. Which approach better fits the program‚Äôs risk tolerance and workload capacity? Should we prioritize maximizing automatic matches with some flagged dose mismatches, or prefer fewer but more conservative auto-accepts? How should confidence scores and match criteria be weighted to optimize this trade-off?

4. Salts/esters policy  
   Should certain salt or ester forms (e.g., hydrochloride, hemisuccinate, palmitate) be treated as distinct active molecules for surveillance and reporting, or considered as the same base molecule? What are the implications for data aggregation, monitoring, and public health interpretation? Are there specific esters or salts that should always be grouped or separated? How do these decisions affect the accuracy and usefulness of the matched dataset?

5. Unknowns triage  
   How should we triage unknown tokens extracted during matching? Which categories of unknowns should trigger formulary enrichment (e.g., adding missing drugs to the PNF), local mapping efforts (e.g., creating local aliases or shorthand mappings), or data quality remediation (e.g., correcting typos, OCR errors, or inconsistent formats)? What workflow or criteria should guide these decisions to efficiently improve coverage and data quality over time? Should some unknowns be prioritized for immediate action based on frequency or impact?
